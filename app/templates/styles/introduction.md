Styleguide Driven Development
-----------------------------

Styleguide Driven Development (SDD) is a practice that encourages the separation of UX, Design & Frontend from Backend concerns. This is achieved by developing the UI separately in a styleguide.

By separating the UI and backend tasks so they don’t rely on each other, it allows teams to iterate fast on prototypes and designs without having to make changes to the backend. With careful planning they should plug-and-play together nicely.

SDD isn’t just limited for big teams working on large applications, but the core concepts of developing UI elements separately in a styleguide (living or static) can still benefit a sole developer working on a single page app.
